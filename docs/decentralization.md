# Nexus and HS Decentralization — Configuration Reference

These are technical notes describing configuration fields related to Decentralization.

---

## 1. Background

Originally the watcher pointed at one primary HS and bulk-ingested all of
its events. With decentralization, Nexus still bulk-indexes the primary HS but
*also* indexes users hosted on other ("third-party") HSs on a per-user
basis, using each HS's user-events endpoint. A separate task resolves each user's
currently-published HS from PKDNS/DHT and records it as a
`(:User)-[:HOSTED_BY]->(:Homeserver)` edge, so the indexer knows which users to
pull from which HS.

These run as parallel tasks started in `NexusWatcher::start`, each driving one
runner; the sections below group each config field under the runner it drives:

- [Section 2: Bulk indexing of primary HS](#2-indexing-the-primary-hs-bulk)
- [Section 3: Key-based indexing of externally-hosted users](#3-indexing-externally-hosted-users-key-based)
- [Section 4: User → HS resolution](#4-user--hs-resolution)
- [Section 5: Event retry & backoff](#5-event-retry--backoff--watcherretry)
- [Section 6: Quick reference](#6-quick-reference)

## 2. Indexing the primary HS (bulk)

The baseline, pre-decentralization path: the primary HS is indexed in *bulk* — all
of its events are pulled from the HS `/events` endpoint. Driven by `HsEventProcessorRunner`.

The primary HS is trusted, which implies a different event validation model.

### `homeserver`

> The single primary, prioritized HS. Its events are bulk-ingested.

It is explicitly *excluded* from the third-party (`KeyBasedEventProcessorRunner`)
list so it is never double-indexed (`hs_by_priority`). Changing this re-points
the entire primary-HS pipeline; the HS is persisted to the graph on startup
(`Homeserver::persist_if_unknown`).

### `events_limit`

> Maximum number of events fetched **per run** from the primary HS.

Validated at deserialize time (`deserialize_events_limit`): `0` is rejected, and
values above the max are rejected rather than clamped.

*Tuning:* higher → more throughput per tick but larger batches and longer
per-run latency. Lower → smoother but slower to drain a backlog.

### `primary_hs_monitoring_interval_ms`

> Scheduling interval[^1] for triggering runs of the **primary-HS** indexing runner
> (`HsEventProcessorRunner`).

*Tuning:* lower → fresher data, more load on HSs and DBs. Higher → less load,
more lag between an event being published and indexed.

---

## 3. Indexing externally-hosted users (key-based)

The core of decentralization. Driven by `KeyBasedEventProcessorRunner`, which
indexes users hosted on **third-party** HSs — any HS other than the primary
(also called "external" or "secondary"). For every monitored HS *except* the
primary, it pulls each hosted user's events per user from the HS `/events-stream`
endpoint (hence "key-based" — keyed on each user's pubky). Configured in
`KeyBasedEventProcessorRunner::from_config`.

### `monitored_homeservers_limit`

> Bounds the number of **third-party** HSs monitored.

`0` disables third-party-HS indexing; `1` monitors one third-party HS.

*Tuning:* each additional monitored HS adds HS requests (and, upstream, PKDNS
resolutions) per tick. Raise deliberately as the network of indexed HSs grows.

*Monitoring:* the runner exports two gauges on every external-HS run
(`external_hs_monitoring_interval_ms`):

| Metric | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `watcher.external_hs.monitored_limit` | gauge | The cap in force. |
| `watcher.external_hs.indexed` | gauge | External HSs the last run selected for indexing: the active HSs, minus the primary HS and blacklisted ones, truncated to the limit. |

`indexed / monitored_limit` is the saturation ratio: it reaches `1` when the
eligible external HSs fill the cap, which is when the limit binds coverage. It
does not separate a set that exactly fills the cap from one truncated by it, so
treat `1` as "at capacity, raise the limit deliberately" rather than proof that
homeservers were dropped. Gauges keep their last value while the process is
alive, so a `monitored_homeservers_limit` of `0` exports a zero denominator.

### `external_hs_monitoring_interval_ms`

> Scheduling interval[^1] for this `KeyBasedEventProcessorRunner` (the external-HS
> monitoring task). Independent of `primary_hs_monitoring_interval_ms` so the two
> cadences can be tuned separately.

*Tuning:* lower → fresher data from external HSs, more load on them and the DBs.
Higher → less load, more lag. External-HS runs typically touch many users across
many HSs, so this is often set larger than `primary_hs_monitoring_interval_ms`.

### `key_based_events_limit`

> Maximum events **per user, per run** when pulling from third-party HSs.

Validated at deserialize time (`deserialize_key_based_events_limit`).

*Why the ceiling is lower than `events_limit`:* this limit is *per user*, not
*per HS*. A run may touch many users across many HSs, so the per-user batch is
kept small to bound total work and per-HS request size.

### `initial_backoff_secs` / `max_backoff_secs` — offline-HS backoff

> Per-HS exponential backoff for third-party HSs found to be **offline/unreachable**
> (`HomeserverBackoff`). After a failure the HS is skipped for `initial_backoff_secs`;
> the skip interval doubles on each consecutive failure, capped at `max_backoff_secs`.

*Constraint:* `initial_backoff_secs` must not exceed `max_backoff_secs`
(`HomeserverBackoff::new`).

*Tuning:* larger initial/cap → fewer wasted requests to dead HSs, but slower to
notice one coming back. Smaller → faster recovery, more retry traffic.

> ⚠️ **Do not confuse these with `[watcher.retry].initial_backoff_secs` /
> `max_backoff_secs`.** Same names, different mechanism — see
> [Section 5](#5-event-retry--backoff--watcherretry).

### `external_hs_pk_blacklist` — HS public-key blacklist

> Configured in `[stack.net]`. List of third-party HS PKs from which new events
> are not being indexed, for as long as they are on this list. Consulted when
> indexing third-party HSs, and also checked when ingesting new users (e.g. via
> the Nexus REST API).

Each entry is parsed as a `PubkyId` at deserialize time, so an invalid pubky in
the list fails config load rather than being silently ignored
(`test_external_hs_pk_blacklist_rejects_invalid_pk`).

*Effect on existing data:* existing events from users pointing to a listed HS are
not affected. New users pointing to a listed HS will not be ingested.
Already-ingested users who now point to a blacklisted HS keep their old data;
only new events from the blacklisted HS are not indexed.

*Effect on dependencies:* events depending on a not-yet-ingested user hosted by a
blacklisted HS (a follow, a tag, a reply or repost referencing their posts) are
dropped rather than queued for retry, since the dependency cannot be ingested
while blacklisted. Removing the HS from the list later does not recover these
dropped events. Posts that merely mention such a user are still indexed; only the
mention relationship is not materialized.

## 4. User → HS resolution

Driven by `UserHsResolverRunner`. For each user it resolves the currently
published HS from PKDNS/DHT and persists/refreshes the
`(:User)-[:HOSTED_BY]->(:Homeserver)` edge with a `resolved_at` timestamp.
This is what tells the externally-hosted-user indexer
([Section 3](#3-indexing-externally-hosted-users-key-based)) which users
belong to which HS.

### `hs_resolver_interval_ms`

> Scheduling interval[^1] for triggering runs of the resolver task.

**Independent** of `primary_hs_monitoring_interval_ms` and
`external_hs_monitoring_interval_ms` — resolution and indexing tick on separate clocks.

*Tuning:* lower → mappings react faster to users migrating HSs, more PKDNS/DHT
traffic. Higher → less traffic, slower to notice a user's HS change.

### `hs_resolver_ttl`

> Minimum age before a user's HS mapping is considered stale and eligible for
> re-resolution.

A user whose `HOSTED_BY.resolved_at` is newer than this TTL is **skipped** on a
resolver run, preventing redundant PKDNS lookups.

*Tuning:* lower → mappings stay fresher at the cost of far more PKDNS lookups.
Higher → cheaper, but Nexus may keep pulling a user's events from an HS they have
already left for up to ~`hs_resolver_ttl`.

### Monitoring stale mappings

When the resolver cannot reproduce a user's stored HS from PKDNS, it marks the
`HOSTED_BY` edge `stale` and the watcher **stops indexing that user**. A
resolution outage (DHT/relay unreachable, PKARR records not resolvable) therefore
silently pauses indexing for every user the resolver visits until the mapping
realigns. The resolver exports these metrics to catch this:

| Metric | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `nexus.task.hs-resolver.resolutions` | counter, labels `outcome`, `mapping` | One per user the resolver handled. `outcome`: `resolved` (PKDNS returned a HS), `unresolved` (PKDNS returned none; on pubky 0.9.3 DHT and relay failures also surface this way), `error` (the lookup failed, pubky 0.10+, or the graph read/update failed). `mapping`: the stored mapping's state before the resolution, `unbound` / `active` / `stale`, or `unknown` when a graph read or write failed (a Neo4j problem, also visible via `neo4j.query.errors`; deliberately outside the `mapping="active"` onset ratio). |
| `nexus.task.hs-resolver.marked_stale` | counter, label `reason` | Users whose mapping flipped from active to stale. `unresolved`: PKDNS returned no HS. `hs_changed`: PKDNS returned a different HS. Already-stale users are not counted again. |
| `nexus.task.hs-resolver.mapped_users` | gauge | Non-deleted users with a `HOSTED_BY` mapping. Recorded on the first run after startup, then refreshed after every run that processed users. |
| `nexus.task.hs-resolver.stale_users` | gauge | Subset of `mapped_users` whose mapping is currently stale. |
| `nexus.task.hs-resolver.heartbeat_timestamp` | gauge, unit `s` | Unix time of the resolver's most recent progress: a user handled or a run finished. |

Prometheus alerting rules for these metrics live in
[`docker/otel/alerts.yaml`](../docker/otel/alerts.yaml), loaded by the local
observability stack (metric names as translated by the Prometheus exporter;
under SigNoz drop the `_total` / `_seconds` suffixes):

- `NexusHsResolverUnresolvedRatio` — onset: most previously-active mappings the
  resolver touched recently could not be resolved. Scoped to `mapping="active"`
  because unbound users with no published record are re-resolved on every tick
  and would otherwise dominate the ratio. It marks onset, not duration: when the
  outage surfaces as `unresolved` (always on pubky 0.9.3), each active mapping
  is flipped stale on its visit, so the alert clears once every active mapping
  has come due (one `hs_resolver_ttl` or more into the outage), not when PKDNS
  recovers.
- `NexusHsResolverStaleRatio` — blast radius, the "still broken" signal: a
  meaningful share of mapped users is not being indexed. Clears only as stale
  users are re-resolved, up to `hs_resolver_ttl` after recovery.
- `NexusHsResolverSilent` — no resolver progress. Gauges keep exporting their
  last value while the process is alive, so only the heartbeat reveals a task
  that hangs or stops ticking; the `absent` half covers a dead process. The
  threshold assumes the default `hs_resolver_interval_ms`; scale it if you
  raise the interval.

The two ratio alerts carry an absolute floor, so they need no retuning as the
user base grows and stay quiet on tiny deployments.

A burst of `marked_stale{reason="hs_changed"}` is usually a real migration, not
an outage, and is worth a lower-severity notification.

## 5. Event retry & backoff — `[watcher.retry]`

Cross-cutting: applies to **all** indexing, driven by `RetryProcessor`. Backoff
parameters and retry limits are selected per error via
`EventRetryConfig::get_backoff_params` / `get_max_retries_for_err`: *transient*
errors and *missing-dependency* errors use separate values.

### `max_retries` / `max_dependency_retries` — retry limits

> Maximum retry attempts before an event is dead-lettered. `max_retries` applies to
> **transient** errors; `max_dependency_retries` applies to `MissingDependency`.

`max_dependency_retries` is higher than `max_retries` because it is a safety net
for HSs that disappear silently (content gone, no DEL event) — the missing
dependency may still arrive, so it is worth polling for longer.

### `initial_backoff_secs` / `max_backoff_secs` — transient-error backoff

> Exponential backoff for re-trying an **individual event** that hit a **transient**
> processing error: `initial_backoff_secs` is the base delay, doubling on each
> attempt, capped at `max_backoff_secs`.

### `initial_missing_dep_backoff_secs` / `max_missing_dep_backoff_secs` — missing-dependency backoff

> Exponential backoff for polling a `MissingDependency`: `initial_missing_dep_backoff_secs`
> is the base delay, doubling on each attempt, capped at `max_missing_dep_backoff_secs`.

Kept separate from the transient-error backoff above because a missing dependency
is waited-on rather than retried-against — it starts slower (`60` s vs `10` s) to
avoid hammering an HS for content that may not exist yet.

> ⚠️ **Two distinct "backoff" systems — do not conflate them:**
>
> - **`[watcher].initial_backoff_secs` / `max_backoff_secs`**
>   ([Section 3](#3-indexing-externally-hosted-users-key-based)) — skips
>   an **entire HS** found to be **offline/unreachable**.
> - **`[watcher.retry].initial_backoff_secs` / `max_backoff_secs`** — retries an
>   **individual event** that hit a **transient processing error**.
>
> They share field names but operate at different granularities (HS vs. event)
> and on different triggers (unreachable vs. transient failure).
