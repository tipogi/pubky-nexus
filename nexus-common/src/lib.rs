//! # Nexus Common
//!
//! The `nexus-common` crate provides the core shared utilities and data models for the Nexus stack.
//!
//! It is responsible for:
//! - **Configuration Management:** Loading configuration from TOML files via a trait-based loader.
//! - **Database Connectivity:** Providing connectors and helper functions for interacting with Neo4j and Redis.
//! - **Media Vocabulary:** Naming file variants and the table of which ones a content type has
//!   (deriving them lives in `nexus-webapi`, the only service that does it).
//! - **Data Models:** Defining common models for files, users, posts, tags, notifications, and follow relationships.
//! - **Indexing and Caching:** Offering utilities for indexing data in Redis and retrieving it using cache-first strategies.
//! - **Shared Types and Traits:** Exposing common types (e.g. pagination, timeframe, stream sorting) and traits
//!   used throughout the Nexus stack.
//!
//! This crate forms the foundation for other Nexus services, ensuring consistency and reuse across the backend.
